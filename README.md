# github-script

This action makes it easy to quickly write a script in your workflow that
uses the GitHub API and the workflow run context.

In order to use this action, a `script` input is provided. The value of that
input should be the body of an asynchronous function call. Two arguments will
be provided:

- `github` A pre-authenticated
  [octokit/rest.js](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js) client
- `context` An object containing the [context of the workflow
  run](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/github)
- `core` Functions for inputs, outputs, results, logging, secrets and variables from [@actions/core](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/packages/core)

Since the `script` is just a function body, these values will already be
defined, so you don't have to (see examples below).

See [octokit/rest.js](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/) for the API client
documentation.

**Note** This action is still a bit of an experimentâ€”the API may change in
*future versions. ðŸ™‚
